Jon is a fifth-year PhD Candidate studying broad-scale dynamics of western Atlantic teleost communities. In addition to being a fish geek, Jon has a passion for mathematics and pursued a triple major at the University of Miami. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree with majors in Marine Science, Biology, and Mathematics. Jon is fascinated with metacommunity theory, which seeks to reconcile the local and regional processes that influence the distribution of organisms in space and time. He is using his quantitative skills in a comprehensive study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of marine metacommunities in the Gulf and Caribbean.
