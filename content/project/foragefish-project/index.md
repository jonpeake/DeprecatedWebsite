Lower trophic level species are an important link in the transfer of energy and nutrients through ecosystems. In marine and aquatic systems, this linkage between primary producers and higher-level consumers often includes forage fishes as a critical intermediate. Forage fishes are small- to medium-sized schooling species that are prey to many aquatic predators. Typically fast-growing, short-lived, highly fecund, and abundant, forage fishes make up a large portion of the diets of marine and aquatic fishes, seabirds, and mammals. Forage fishes can also provide large spatial subsidies of energy to a variety of systems through the movement of migratory species across ecosystem boundaries.

Much of the research on the role of forage fishes in marine and aquatic food webs to date has been focused on taxa that transfer energy and nutrients through phytoplankton-based pathways, particularly in pelagic environments. However, forage fishes that rely on benthic sources of production are likely just as important to maintaining coastal ecosystems as those that rely on planktonic pathways. Estuarine habitats are highly productive systems that commonly support both planktonic and benthic channels of energy flow. Because of this, they can also support abundant and diverse assemblages of forage fishes. Estuarine forage fishes not only serve as the primary prey for estuarine predators, they also provide an important source of energy for juveniles and sub-adults of marine predators that use estuaries as essential early-life habitat. Because of the vital role that estuarine forage-fish communities play in connecting planktonic and benthic pathways to both estuarine and marine predators through different life history stages, it is important to understand how these communities vary in composition and structure over space and time.  

For this study, we analyzed a long-term dataset of estuarine forage fish species composition and abundance in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (eGOM) to investigate their spatiotemporal dynamics across four distinct estuaries arranged along a broad latitudinal gradient. The coastal eGOM is a large system spanning two biogeographic provinces and two ecoregions from warm temperate to subtropical latitudes, and includes a variety of estuarine environments supporting a diverse assemblage of predator and prey species. Specifically, we sought to answer three major questions related to estuarine forage fish communities:  

1) How do these communities vary spatially among four major estuaries arranged along a latitudinal gradient of the eGOM?  
2) Do these communities exhibit predictable and synchronous patterns of temporal variability across the region?  
3) How does spatiotemporal variability in community assembly relate to biotic and abiotic components of forage fish habitat?
